The results appear as though having more threads made the execution time
in my program noticably longer.  This could be a result of having multiple 
pthread functions running right after another doing the same calculations.
Also, the results were different depending on the amount of cores I was using, 
if the desired result was that they would be the same, then this was a mistake
my code that I was not able to find in time.  The NO LOCK results had different
results from their WITH LOCK counterparts.  This could be explained by the 
fact that having no lock in the program while multiple threads are processing, 
would result in increments happening onto the primeCount variable simultaneously.
