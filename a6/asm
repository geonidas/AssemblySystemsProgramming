#  CS 218 - Assemble / Link scipt file.

#	This script will assemble and link an
#	assembly language program to an executable.
#	This script expects 1 argument, which is the
#	name of the assembly language source file.
#	The extension is assumed to be '.asm' and
#	thus should NOT be entered.

#	Note, before using, must make the file executable.
#	Assuming the file is named 'asm', at the command
#	line prompt, type:  chmod +x asm
#	This adds execute priveledge to the file, so it
#	can be executed as a script.

# -----
#  Ensure some arguments were entered
#  Disply usage message if not

if [ -z $1 ]; then
	echo "Usage:  ./asm <asmMainFile> (no extension)"

# -----
#  Verify no extensions were entered

if [ ! -e "$1.asm" ]; then
	echo "Error, $1.asm not found."
	echo "Note, do not enter file extensions."
	exit
fi

# -----
#  Compile, assemble, and link.
